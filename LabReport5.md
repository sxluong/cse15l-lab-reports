<h1> The command `less` </h1>

Brief Introduction : The `less` command allows one to view the contents of a specific file one screen at a time. It essentially takes you to another tab/screen in the bash terminal where you can navigate the contents using your arrows and mouse. It also allows you to search for certain patterns using `/` followed by whatever you're searching for. `less` has many more different command options to seamlessly view the contents of a file.
